# myScorecardsAndroid

This is a simple boxing/MMA/combat sport scorecard app.  That "10-point must system" that combat sports fans have a love/hate relationship with.

Yes, the implementation is probably done so many times (and better), but I just wanted to do my own.

And it's my first attempt at an Android app.  It works and the perfectionist in me will keep refactoring this and utilize other external libraries out there that might make some of this easier.

Oh and I tried to follow Google's Material Design guidelines.
